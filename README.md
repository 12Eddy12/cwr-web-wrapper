[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

A minimalist Django implementation, requiring no database, and no environment variables. For a deployment on Heroku/Dokku.

Made as a web-based proof of concept for Python libraries:

* Music Metadata - Territories: https://github.com/musicmetadata/territories
* Music Metadata - EDI: https://github.com/musicmetadata/edi

More to come...

This branch will not deploy, as it is uses private dependencies!
